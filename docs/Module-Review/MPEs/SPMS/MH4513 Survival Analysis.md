## Course Summary

Learning about Non-Parametric and Parametric Distribution for modelling time to event T. Builds alot on statistical knowledge and introduces new things such as Hazard Functions, Survival Functions, AFT Models, Cox PH Model

## Workload

Quite reasonable, 1 Group Project, 1 Quiz, 1 Individual Lab, 1 Finals

## Projects

Group Project doing analysis on given datasets (Similar to MH3511)

## Things to take note of

Initial Learning curve might be quite hard, but the module itself gets really doable once you put in time to understand the concepts. The final exam paper is doable as well and the prof will give a "What to study" tip in the last lecture that isnt recorded.

## Conclusion

Would recommend taking if you enjoyed statistics in general and want to understand how to analyse non-parametric data since we are used to having assumptions in our data analysis.
